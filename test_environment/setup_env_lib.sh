### N.B. all functions in this file should be stateless, and accept any state as parameters
### N.B. all functions that accept a ship should always accept an normal/"unsafe" @p, and call `safepatp` themselves
###      in addition, all library functions that call other library functions should pass in the "unsafe" patp.
###      this is mainly just for uniform code
