# Airlock â€” Java Edition

Communicate with an Urbit ship over the eyre protocol in Java

[![awesome urbit badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/~-awesome%20urbit-lightgrey)](https://github.com/urbit/awesome-urbit)

## Example
```java
public class Main {

	private static final Gson gson = new Gson();

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String url = "http://localhost:8080";
		String shipName = "zod";
		String code = "lidlut-tabwed-pillex-ridrup";

		// SETUP
        // The following example assumes you have:
        // - a ship named 'zod' running
        // - a chat channel called 'test' (you must manually create this)


        // MARK - connect to the ship
		Urbit urbit = new Urbit(url, shipName, code);
        urbit.authenticate();
		urbit.connect();
	}
}

```

For the most up to date usage examples, see `src/test/java/UrbitIntegrationTestsCore.java` and related.

The file `src/main/java/Main.java` serves as a starting point to experiment with the library, 
but may not showcase all features and functionality of the api. 




## Using

**WARNING: The library is currently in alpha and does not really have a stable api yet. Expect things to break and change**

Currently, the simplest way to play around with the library is to download the source and edit the `Main.java` file yourself.

### Running From Source
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ynx0/urbit`
2. In the cloned repository, run `./gradlew run`. This will run the `Main.java` class.
3. Edit `Main.java` to experiment

### Jar
If the code is alpha, using the jar is the greek letter before that. It most likely doesn't work.
To generate a jar from the source, all you have to do is run `./gradlew jar`.

However, if you want to try it out, you can download the jar without actually downloading the repository:
1. Go to the [Github Actions](https://github.com/ynx0/urbit/actions) workflows page
2. Find a commit with `Java CI with gradle` underneath that has is passing (has green checkmark).
3. Under the **Artifacts** heading, click on `all-jars`. This will download the jar that was generated from the aforementioned task.





## Roadmap

- [x] Minimum viable product
- [x] Basic integration tests
    - [x] Github Actions automatically tests on push/pr to `master`
- [x] Basic documentation
    - [x] Build javadocs
- [x] Implementation of `scry` and `spider` request types
- [ ] Integration for `scry` and `spider`
    - [x] `scry`
    - [x] `spider`
- [x] Custom Exceptions for core interface 

- [x] `graph-store`
    - [x] Initial functional implementation of interface 
    - [x] Graph store tests
    - [x] Graph store documentation
    - [x] Graph store examples

- [ ] Other gall agent interfaces

- [ ] Implementation of surrounding libraries
  - [ ] atom manipulation
  - [ ] related urbit types

  ### Deprecated
- [ ] Implementation of `chat-store`/`chat-view`
  - [ ] Initial functional implementation of interface to agents
  - [ ] Graph store tests
  - [ ] Graph store documentation
  - [ ] Graph store examples



### After Stabilization
- [ ] Create example application that uses basic functionality
- [ ] Examples based off of integration tests
- [ ] Create build process (i.e. publishing artifacts to a repository)
- [ ] Soundness tests for various parts of the library (i.e. unit tests)
    - [ ] Urbit uid and hexString
    - [ ] atom manipulation
    - [ ] related urbit types
