# Graph Store Notes


1. what's the diff between managed and unmanaged graphs?
    * an unmanaged resource doesnt belong to a group, it has its own, hidden group to itself. it's used for stuff our ship owns, or for dms 
2. what does groupify graph do? turn a graph unmanaged -> managed?
    * groupify lets you shove a graph from your hidden group to a group located elsewhere 
3. what are tag queries? i haven't seen them used yet so there's not much reference to go off of. 
   * tag queries are when you're asking for, eg. "who can write to publish" -- it's roles, basically, and we havent used them very much yet. each tag is a set of ships
